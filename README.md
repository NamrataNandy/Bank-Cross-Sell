# Cross-sell to customer base

## Objective

A consumer bank with a range of products would like to cross-sell insurance to its consumer base (that is, cross-sell the personal protection insurance (PPI) to those customers who have a secured or unsecured type of loan, but no PPI product as yet). 

The sample dataset from their customer portfolio contains various fields about their product ownership, credit standing, outstanding amounts, and whether they already have an insurance product (called as PPI ) if any, the type of PPI product they own.

The project adopts analytics driven approach on the sample data for deciding:

-	Who should be targeted from the pool of customers that currently do not have a PPI, and 
-	What type of PPI product they should be targeted with.

The results of the analysis would be used in designing a simple, but effective strategy to achieve the goal of cross-sell.
